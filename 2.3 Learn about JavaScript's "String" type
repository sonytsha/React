the "string" type

let mystring = "hello";
let singlequotestring = 'hello';
let doublequotestring = "hello";
let backtickstring = `hello`;

backtick strings : 
let backtickstring = `hello $(name)`;

string properties : 
let mystring = 'hello';
mystring.length; =====> 6
mystring.charAt(0); =====> 'h'
mystring.toUpperCase(); =====> 'HELLO'
mystring.toLowerCase(); =====> 'hello'

The escape character : 
" " how do i use quotes ? " she asked " ; // error 
let question = "\" how do i use quotes ?\" she asked ";  ====== > backslash here is called escape character 
or
let question = ' " how do i use quotes?"she asked';
or let question = " ' how do i use quotes ? ' she asked ";

\n ===== > new line
let poetry = "One fish \n two fish " =====> output 
one fish
two fish


Concatenating Strings : 

1st way :

let firstname = "John";
let lastname = "doe";
let fullname = firstname + " " + lastname ; // output = "John doe"

2nd way : 

let firstname = "John";
let lastname = "doe";
let fullname = firstname.concat(" ").concat(lastname); // output = "John doe"

adding numbers and strings : 

let x = 5;
let mystring = " x is " + x; // output : x is 5

let x = 5;
let y = 8;
let mystring = "x plus y is " + x + y; // output : x plus y is 58  =====> derived way : 1) "x plus y is " + x + y ==> 2) "x plus y is 5" + y ==> 3) x plus y is 58
let mystring = "x plus y is " + ( x + y ) ; output : x plus y is 13
