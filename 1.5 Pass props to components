 React sort of takes this idea and runs with it. React components can take props which are attributes that we can pass into our components to change something about them. 

With text inputs for example, we can pass a placeholder attribute to change the hint text that shows up before the user types anything. Or as we've seen with image tags, we can pass a source attribute here to define what image should be displayed.
