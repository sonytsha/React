// defining variable in JS is done with one of 2 keywords, var or let
var myVariable = 5; // function-scoped
or
let yourVariable = "Hello "; // block-scoped

// defining constants in JS is done with const keyword
const myConst = 505;
myConst = 101; -- > error
once a variable is defined using const, it can not be reassigned to another value

globalVarible = "Global" --- this is a valid syntax to define a variable in JS, without even const

The 8 data types in JS : 
1)N number
2) string
3) boolean
4) objects
5) functions
6) undefined
7) bigints
8) symbols

variables dont have types, only values have types

// the "typeof " operator

let x = 5;
let y = "I am a string!";

typeof x;
typeof y;
