// these loops are usually used when we don't know exactly how many iterations we need for our loop to complete.

while(somecondition) { 
// do something 
}

while ( false ) {
// never executed }

do-while loop : 
do {
// do something }
while( somecondition);

do {
// executed once 
} while(false);

do-while will execute atleast once for do even if while is false , ( while false will means while will never execute)
