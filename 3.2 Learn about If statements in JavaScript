() is mandetory in JS

values od all types can be truthy or falsy

// For example, instead of explicitly checking of a string's length as greater than zero, we can simply say if my string and since empty strings are treated as falsy in JavaScript
, the body of this if statement won't be executed if the string's length is zero. 

let mystring = "";
if( mystring) {
// this wont be executed }
else {
// but this will }

which values are 'truthy' and 'falsy' in JS :

"" --> falsy
[] --> truthy
{} --> truthy
NaN --> falsy
Infinity --> truthy
0 --> falsy

"" == false                    IN JS --> true
0 == false                     IN JS --> true
0n == false                    IN JS --> true
NaN == true                    IN JS --> false
Null == true                   IN JS --> false
Undefined == true              IN JS --> false

// It's true that the empty string zero and zero N are double equal to false in JavaScript but not a number isn't. And neither are null and undefined. And these last three are 
considered falsy by JavaScript. And furthermore, an empty array is double equal to false but it's considered truthy by JavaScript. 

// These are the seven values that JavaScript treats as falsy. The rest of the possible values in JavaScript are treated as truthy.

 ************************* The 7 falsy values are :  *****************************************
1) ""
2) 0
3) 0n
4) NaN
5) undefined
6) null 
7) false

all others are truthy

if statement in JS :

let x = 100;
if( x> 5) {
// do something 
}

AND operator : 
let x = 100;)
if ( x > 5 && x < 100 ) {
// do something }

the OR operator : 

let x = 100;
if ( ( x == 5 ) || ( x == 10 ) {
// do something 
}

The NOT operator : 

let x = 100;
if ( ! ( x> 99) {
// do something }

Combining operators : 

if(!iscompleted && x < 5) {
// do  something 
} else if ( x > 100 || !isTuesday) {
// do something else }
else {
// do some other thing }
