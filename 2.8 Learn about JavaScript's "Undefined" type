undefined means either variable does nopt exist or has not been assigned a value yet

let x;
typeof x; 

type : undefined

typeof bananas; ===>undefined

This is also the case, if we try and access a property that doesn't exist on an object or an index that doesn't exist in an array. 

let person = { name: "shaun"};
person.age; ===> undefined

let myarray = [1,2,3];
myarray[100]; ===> undefined

We'll also get undefined as the return value of a function that doesn't use the return keyword to return a value.

function donothing() { }
let result = donothing(); ===> result is undefined

at a high level, the difference between undefined and null, is something like this. Undefined means that we either haven't 
declared a variable or we have declared a variable, but haven't actually assigned it a value. So, you could think of undefined as being, 
the sort of default value for variables before we've actually assigned them a real value. Although, technically undefined is the lack of an 
assigned value, but really we're just kinda getting down to semantics at that point. Null, on the other hand, usually means that a piece of data has
been defined and we've explicitly assigned the value, null to it. I sometimes see null used to mean something like, this value does exist, but at this 
point we don't know what it is. So, for example, if you're entering a person's data into a program and they didn't fill out their age, they do have an age but 
we just don't know it yet. So, we might explicitly assign null for the person's age in this case. 

let myvariable;
typeof myvariable; ==> undefined
typeof bananas ; ==> undefined

let person = {
name : "sony shaw",
age : null,
}

typeof undefined ; === > undefined
typeof null ; ==> object

When we're using default values for function arguments, passing undefined for an argument, we'll use the default value instead. Whereas passing null for an argument 
won't trigger the use of the default value. And again, all of this about default values is something we'll discuss later on, when we go into more detail.

function.print(msg = "default") {
console.log(msg);
}

print("hello"); prints hello
print(undefined); prints default
print(null); prints null
