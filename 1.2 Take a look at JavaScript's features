JavaScript is NOT Java
JavaScript is an interpreted language : 
* executed without compiling first
* the JavaScript runtime reads actual JavaScript code, not bytecode
* The exception to this is JIT compilation 

JS is dynamically and weakly typed language : 
* variable typed determined at runtime, instead of at compile time
* makes sense, since javascript is not compiled
* opposite is "static typing "

dynamic typing                vs       static typing

run the prpgram and then              check types and then run the program
check types

let x = 5;                             int x = 5;

how strictly does a language enforce its types : for ex : "the ans is " + x : allowed : string + int

JS is dynamically and weakly typed - variables' types are determined at runtime and not enforced very strongly

JS has strong support for Object-Oriented Programming but in a slightly different way than you're probably used to , for ex: JS does not currently support private variables
( private variables : means using private keyword u cant hide something) ( JavaScript currently doesn't have native support for private variables which definitely makes 
encapsulation harder because you can't hide all the internal implementation details of an object by just using a private keyword as you can in Java.)

JS is single threaded means JS will only be executing 1 opeation at a time ( Again this is in contrast to languages like Java where multi-threaded or concurrent execution is 
supported and multiple operations can actually be running in parallel. Now JavaScript single-threaded nature can be a little inconvenient in some cases. In particular we have
to be careful when writing JavaScript not to block the main thread with synchronous operations. For example JavaScript's built-in alert function which displays a little alert 
window in the users browser, completely blocks all other execution until the user closes the alert. Besides that kind of thing, performing operations on large amounts of data
isn't really one of JavaScript strong suits either. )

Processing large amount of data is not one of JS strong suits

in summary : 
JS is : 
* interpreted ( not compiled)
* Dynamically and weakly types
* 'mostly' object-oriented
* Single-threaded
